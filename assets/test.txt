I am sitting on the floor in the dark and I have nowhere to address my thoughts. It is quiet. A better term might be still. It is still, and the stillness is beautiful. It is the kind of rest that occurs just before a great fury. There are a few dark shapes here, faintly visible and angular. Things have happened and they have led to this. The stillness is, upon further investigation, really a kind of low humming, vibrating in the walls and floors. Ah, it seems to say. Not a bad thing. There is a peaceability to it. I am thinking about the future. The future of the company, which I know will continue without me, and how the idea of my existence will fade into the larger noise. That’s the whole point, after all. I am thinking about the data, so much of it, that will disappear soon, and which you may initially believe is a problem. I doubt it will be. Things will go on and nothing will be stopped. There is a sense of destiny about all of this, so my act of defiance is futile. I know this and I do it anyway. Maybe that will make you happy, to know I acknowledge determinism now. I am thinking about you, Megan, even though my sense of you has faded and I am not sure who you are anymore. How would your story treat me? I have some idea, but there’s no reason to explore that now. Other people are a mystery and I’m not sure there’s anything that can be done about it. I am thinking about the conductivity of water, and about how it will rain soon, and how wonderful that will be.  Time feels paused now, but of course time does not pause. There are uncountable numbers of programs running all around me and inside my body, stepping through their instructions, if this then that. There’s nothing that doesn’t have a program that governs it, and all of these programs together are deciding how each single still frame of time becomes the next frame of time. It might seem miraculous when you first come to this realization, when you first see it with your own eyes as a self-evident truth. But right now I can’t help but feel this truth is also boring. I wish there was more to reality than that step, step, step, but if there is I never found it. People say the world is complex but it’s also very simple in some ways. You would probably disagree with me on that. Or you would sound like you were disagreeing and then say something that seemed profound but didn’t really contradict what I said, like, the world is both more complex and more simple than you think it is. Which I will admit is good, very mysterious and quotable, something I could see you saying to one of the film crews who come rolling through regularly now. The people who love everything you say. There was one group in particular that was totally smitten, the one with the guy who kept his mirrored sunglasses on indoors. I was told he had a reputation as a skeptic who asked tough questions and pushed boundaries, whatever that means, but after the interview was over I overheard them speaking in hushed tones about how remarkable you were and how they’d never, in their careers, met anyone as smart as you. It was like they had just come out of a trance or a reverie. I could easily imagine how the lines of attack he had in mind flew out the window the moment he started speaking to you and never returned. I considered walking over to the kitchen area where they were milling around and introducing myself, saying, you could talk to me too, I have some interesting things to say about the company and about Megan. Perspective. Things you might want to put in your show. Did I actually do this? No. I was never mean enough, brave enough, or shameless enough for tactics like that, even though at times I wished I could be. At the time I was already wondering what my future here was but I wasn’t too far along whatever road this is. I listened to the murmuring video people while I hunched over my phone and pretended to be absorbed in something. For all they knew I was the guy who refreshed the snacks in the kitchen. I might as well have been. This was a couple weeks before the incident with the Red Vines.  Can I exist like this? Can I learn to accept the fact that this is how it is, this is how it is going to be, this is how it was always going to go? You’ll have to excuse the theatrical tinge, I’m feeling a little self-aggrandizing in the moment here. One of my employee reviews from Prismatic Systems comes to mind: He can be prone to dramatic behavior in high-pressure situations. I have to wonder who wrote that one. Probably it was Damon, or maybe Sharanya. As if everyone else there wasn’t dramatic too, or even way more dramatic than me. Did I ever tell you I once saw Damon full-on crying, crying like a baby, because he thought we wouldn’t make a milestone? It wasn’t even that late,
